# Project2: !Fight Club SPA + WebAPI
---

## Project Description
!FightClub is a single page application for users to debate amongst themselves who would win in a battle between two user-created “champions”. Users are able to register/log in and are able to create a character with a trait and randomly selected weapon. Their champion then enters an arena where there will be a forum where users have a determined amount of time to discuss which of two champions would win in a fight based off their characteristics.
